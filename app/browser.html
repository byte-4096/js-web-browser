                            When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father:
                            where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John,
                            and some other relations, I got forty pounds, and a
                            promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at
                            Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven
                            months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.

                            was the third of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel

                            resided three years, and applied myself close to my
